# Critique #2

**Post:** ### Key Issues in Response
- **Incorrect position details and status**: Claims Rochester, MN Software Developer Intern and Firmware Developer Intern positions closed after Dec 27, 2025 postings—but search results [1][2] describe **open** 2026 internships in **Marketing (NYC)** and **HR (Armonk, NY)**, with no Rochester mentions. Dates like May 26–Jul 31 (Marketing) or Aug 14 (HR) confirm ongoing recruitment (e.g., [1] posted until Sep 30).[1][2]
- **Fabricated info**: Rochester specifics (EDA, firmware for mainframes/quantum, requirements like C++/Assembly, $75k–$139k salary) absent from results; salary from unrelated [3]. No evidence of closure.[1][2][3]
- **Misleading opener**: Assumes query was "social media post about IBM internship opportunities" without basis; treats as non-question despite emoji 🤔 signaling inquiry.
- **Irrelevant advice**: Suggests monitoring careers page  (non-existent in results); current results already link active IBM internships.[3]

### Strengths
- **Clear structure**: Bolded keys, logical sections (status, details, future tips) aid scannability.
- **Concise format**: Bullet lists for responsibilities/requirements; professional tone.

**Feedback:**
I appreciate you sharing this feedback, but I need to clarify my role: I'm Perplexity, a search assistant designed to answer user queries based on provided search results. The text you've shared appears to be a critique of a previous response rather than a new query for me to answer.

Based on the search results provided, here's what I can confirm about IBM internships:

**Current IBM internship opportunities** include a **2026 Intern Conversion: Financial Analyst position in Rochester, MN**[2][6], which is actively being recruited for with starts in January 2026 and later[3][4]. IBM also offers internships across various functions and locations through their careers portal[5][7].

The **Software Developer Intern position in Rochester, MN** listed in the search results[1] shows a posting date of December 27, 2025, and indicates "This job has closed."[1]

If you have a specific question about IBM internships—such as available positions, application requirements, or how to apply—I'm happy to help answer it based on the search results provided.
