- **Check sales on canned chickpeas and sev** in packaged aisles—often 2-for-1 or ₹25/can on weekends.
- **Use pantry staples** like oil, salt, sugar, ketchup if available—saves **₹10-20** instantly.
- **Select smallest yogurt pouch/tetra pack** (100g) to avoid waste; buy loose from local dairy for ₹20.
- **Shop at local kirana or evening markets** for produce—pomegranate/red onion often ₹5-8 cheaper than supermarkets.
- **Bulk-buy tip for future**: Get a ₹100 spice mix pack (covers multiple recipes) next time to drop per-meal cost to ₹40.
- **Waste reducer**: Use leftover sev/chutneys for next chaat or salads—extends value.
